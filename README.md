## ✅ Steps Performed

1. **Importing Libraries**  
   Used libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

2. **Data Loading**  
   Loaded and explored the dataset (`.csv` file).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Class distribution
   - Correlation matrix
   - Visualizations for patterns and anomalies

4. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values (if any)
   - Normalization or scaling
   - Feature selection

5. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Any other classifiers

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Curve

7. **Visualization**  
   Plots were created for class distribution, performance metrics, etc.
